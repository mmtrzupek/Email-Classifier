# Email Classifier

An email classifier written in python that determines whether an email is spam/not spam. A Naive Bayes algorithm was used to train a Spam classifier with a dataset (that is subset of the Enron-Spam dataset provided by Ion Androutsopoulos) of emails. Unigram and Bigram models were learned in order to classify emails. The classifier achieved a 95.6% accuracy in determining spam/not spam using the Bigram model.
